# Changelog

Notable changes to millwork. Before 1.0 the API may move between minor
versions; a release says so here when it does.

## 0.1.0

The first release on PyPI.

- A catalogue of components on shadcn/ui: layout, text, inputs, feedback,
  tables, charts, forms from Pydantic models, files, tasks with progress,
  and a chat surface that streams replies from Python.
- One model of state: Python owns it, a page is a function of it, and the
  browser receives patches.
- Files, uploads and downloads over the session's socket, so replicas need
  no sticky routing and no shared storage.
- Sign-in with password, OAuth and proxy-header providers behind one
  `on_login` hook; a theme file in the shadcn token vocabulary.
- A test harness that drives a page without a browser.
- `millwork run` serves an app on a port or a unix socket, behind a proxy
  and under a path prefix; `millwork docs` serves the manual, whose every
  example runs.
